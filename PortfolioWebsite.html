      <h1> My Projects </h1>
      <p> I have an interest in origami, 3D origami, and papercraft. I have folded over 1,000 origami cranes, and used some origami cranes for a project (links to project page) devoted to preserving and protecting migratory birds. </p>
      <p> I have completed several 3D origami projects, including swans, dragons, baskets, and peacocks. In 2015, one of my 3D origami baskets won first place at my school district's art show. In 2018, my 3D origami peacock placed at the state level for the Reflections Art Show. </p>
      <p> I am a self-taught traditional artist who uses ink pens. My favorite media to use are black micron pens, but I also use watercolor brush markers and gel pens. I have been drawing since October, 2017. Most of my drawings feature birds of prey and dragons. </p>
